## Graphics

Each vending machine has an opening where the original control hardware was located. This opening is 6.5" wide by 29" tall.

If the kiosk hardware is housed separately from the vending machine, then a rigid board with graphics must be created to close the opening.

If the kiosk hardware is housed inside the vending machine, then the ipad will take up some of the opening space, but a rigid board with graphics must be created to close the rest of the opening.
